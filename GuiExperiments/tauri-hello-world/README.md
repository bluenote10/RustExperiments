Following:
- https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/sveltekit

The main development command in tauri is:

```sh
$ npm run tauri dev
```

To find out:
- I don't see type errors (TypeScript) in the console when using `npm run tauri dev`.
- The communication between the frontend and the backend is not typed at all :(.
  Is it possible to make them type safe and reduce the boilerplate?
